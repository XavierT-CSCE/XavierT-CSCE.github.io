    <body>I exceptionally excell at being terrible at coding apparently! Also, I do NOT know how to properly push a github website...</body>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <body>Basic Statement: While there are many websites that allow for you to vent your frustrations publically, they're usually tied to some sort of identifier like a username.</body>

    <body>A bit more detailed version: As a person who struggles with mental health issues (anxiety disorders + CPTSD), 
        I've always found it difficult to share how I feel/vent frustrations. While it's possible to make throwaway accounts on website like Twitter/X, 
        that all comes back tied to a certain identifier like a username. Yes, personal applications such as the Notes app does exist, it doesn't allow for someone to give feedback on how to deal with my frustrations. 
        I feel that making some sort of app/website where one can share their frustrations anonymously and recieve feedback on the problem is a good way to help.</body>
    
    <body>Joking! I am very good at deploying a github wesite!! Just... let me work.</body>
